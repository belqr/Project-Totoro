            <h2>Studio Ghibli</h2>
            <p>Studio Ghibli is a Japanese animation studio based in Koganei, Tokyo. Founded in 1985, the studio has produced 21 animated features, the first being Castle in the Sky (1986) and the most recent Memories of Marnie (2014). Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, Toshio Suzuki and Yasuyoshi Tokuma, shortly after the success of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind the previous year. The studio released its first film, Castle in the Sky, the following year. The company's logo is Totoro, the character from the movie My Friend Totoro, released in 1988. With the exception of six productions, all of the studio's films were directed by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. Toshio Suzuki, meanwhile, is the producer for most of them. In 2001, the Ghibli Museum, a museum dedicated to the studio's works, opened.</p>

            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>Two girls move with their father to the countryside of Japan, in order to be close to their mother, who is hospitalized. There, they will live many adventures alongside a friendly protective spirit of the forest called Totoro, who lives in a giant camphor tree.</p>
            <h3>Curiosities</h3>
            <p>It may be the most beloved Japanese animated film since its release, but I bet a lot of people don't know some facts about the film, so check out some relevant facts about the film below.</p>
            <h4>1 - Based by real events</h4>
            <p>A part of the story was inspired by the life of the director himself, when Miyazaki was a child, his mother was hospitalized due to severe spinal tuberculosis, from 1947 to 1955.
            She spent the first few years mostly in hospitals before being treated at home.
            Also, in the movie, Mei and Satsuki's mother has a similar illness and is also hospitalized, but it's not revealed. Some believe it to be the same disease as Miyazaki's mother.</p>
            <h4>2 – Inspired by Alice in Wonderland</h4>
            <p>In the film, there is a clear parallel between Alice in Wonderland and My Friend Totoro. Mei finds a small, white Totoro and follows it until it falls into a hole, just like Alice followed the white rabbit.
            In addition, another very clear reference is the “Gatônibus” from the movie. Her weird smile and crazy eyes are very similar to Alice's Cheshire cat.</p>
            <h4>3 - The movie city exists</h4>
            <p>The film takes place in Tokorozawa town in Saitama, where Miyazaki lived, a community with lots of farmland.</p>
            <h4>4 – Shinto Influences</h4>
            <p>The Shinto religion is very strong in Japan and the film makes references, from nature's relationship with spirits, Satsuki's prayer to find Mei and the relationship of Kami spirits with humans.</p>
